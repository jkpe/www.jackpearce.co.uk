I recently set out to build an RSS reader web app on top of Cloudflare Workers, integrating with the Google Reader API. This project seemed like the perfect opportunity to put two of the most talked-about AI-powered IDEs to the test: **Cursor** (my current go-to) and **Kiro** (Amazon's new challenger).

In this post, I'll share my experience using both IDEs for this specific project, comparing their AI capabilities, developer experience, and overall effectiveness for modern web development.

## The Project Setup

My goal was to build a lightweight, fast RSS reader that could handle thousands of feeds efficiently. The technical requirements included:

- **Cloudflare Workers** for serverless deployment
- **Google Reader API** integration for feed management
- **Modern JavaScript/TypeScript** with ES modules
- **Responsive web interface** with real-time updates
- **Efficient caching** and data management

This project would test both IDEs' abilities to handle modern web development patterns, API integrations, and performance optimization.
