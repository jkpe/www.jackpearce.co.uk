ðŸ’¡ **This post is very old now and the information below may well be inaccurate.**

ðŸ¤” **6th April 2014:** TalkTalk [appear](https://gist.github.com/Joev-/0e3cc1a3b613c54d97bb) to be doing something similar

ðŸ¤“ **7th April 2014:** [Plusnet](http://equk.co.uk/2014/04/07/uk-isps-providing-cdn-for-google/) are doing it too. The responses to my post have hightlighted that using DNSCrypt + OpenDNS doesnâ€™t allow you to opt out of this behaviour which suggests a deal between the ISPs, Google and OpenDNS has been made.

Virgin Media why does *[www.google.com](http://www.google.com/) resolve to host-62-253-8-99.not-set-yet.virginmedia.net*? What a funny name for a PTR record, but seriously, why are you manipulating my traffic?

I was testing something only to find that google.com, google.co.uk both resolve to an IP address owned by Virgin Media.

    PING google.com (62.253.3.103): 56 data bytes 64 bytes from 62.253.3.103: icmp_seq=0 ttl=58 time=17.569 ms
    
    nslookup www.google.com Server: 208.67.222.222 Address: 208.67.222.222#53 Non-authoritative answer: Name: www.google.com Address: 62.253.3.103
    
    host 62.253.3.103 103.3.253.62.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer host-62-253-8-103.not-set-yet.virginmedia.net.

Performing a `dig a google.com +trace` fools me into thinking that ns1.google.com is dishing out these Virgin owned IPs, yet a query from elsewhere tells me otherwise.

**Using Virgin Media**

    dig a google.com @ns1.google.com
    ;; ANSWER SECTION: google.com. 300 IN A 62.253.3.99 
    google.com. 300 IN A 62.253.3.93

    google.com. 300 IN A 62.253.3.104 
    google.com. 300 IN A 62.253.3.89
    

**Another ISP**

    dig a google.com @ns1.google.com
    ;; ANSWER SECTION: google.com. 300 IN A 74.125.136.113 
    google.com. 300 IN A 74.125.136.100 
    google.com. 300 IN A 74.125.136.102 
    google.com. 300 IN A 74.125.136.138 
    google.com. 300 IN A 74.125.136.101 
    google.com. 300 IN A 74.125.136.139
    

Most odd. Especially seeing as I **do not use Virgin Mediaâ€™s DNS resolvers**, I use OpenDNS.*m7.lon.opendns.com* to be exact, according to [www.dnsleaktest.com](http://www.dnsleaktest.com/). [OpenDNSâ€™ cache check](http://cachecheck.opendns.com/) matches my other ISP, a whole bunch of IPs none of which are anywhere near this 62.253.3.0/24 weâ€™re seeing from Virgin Media.

So for some reason Virgin Media someone is manipulating the DNS response I recieve from OpenDNSâ€™ 208.67.222.222, 208.67.220.220 for google.com, google.co.uk and possibly other domains. Theyâ€™re also proxying google.com to me as loading [http://62.253.3.103](http://62.253.3.103/) in a web browser shows me Googleâ€™s home page, creepy. Ok so where does a traceroute take me?

> *traceroute: Warning: google.com has multiple addresses; using 62.253.3.93 traceroute to google.com (62.253.3.93), 64 hops max, 52 byte packets*

- 8 * * *

Most interesting that it stops here: *haye-**icdn**-1-ae0-0.network.virginmedia.net (62.253.174.242)*

**haye-icdn-1, what do you do?** A quick google (ironic) reveals [this thread](http://www.cableforum.co.uk/board/12/33694218-virgin-hijacking.html) titled â€˜Virgin hijackingâ€™. One user suggests:

> Content Distribution Network ran by Virgin to try and speed things up. Itâ€™s not really hijacking, per-se and if it worked, it would actually be a good thing. The problem is, itâ€™s heavily congested so has the opposite effect.

â€¦.

I have no idea why Virgin and OpenDNS feel the need to proxy or CDN google.com for me. The ping response time to one of Googleâ€™s actual IPs is 20.049 ms. From now on I will encrypt my DNS traffic to OpenDNS using [DNSCrypt](http://dnscrypt.org/) and one of the suggested DNS providers, it takes 5 seconds to install their app.

Ahh, thatâ€™s better :-)

## Some Notes

- My Virgin SuperHub is in modem mode
- Itâ€™s entirely possible Virgin Media has struck a deal with OpenDNS however I couldnâ€™t find mention of that anywhere and it seems unlikely. The responses to this post have led me to believe some deal has been made.
